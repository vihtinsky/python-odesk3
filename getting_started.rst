Some examples of using listed in the odesk/examples folder.
Here is the simple example.

Initializing the client::

    client = odesk.Client(public_key, secret_key)

Shows the url to get frob from it after app authorization on odesk and getting redirect to callback::

    print client.auth.auth_url()

Waiting for inputing the frob::

    print "After that you should be redirected back to your app URL with " + \
          "additional ?frob= parameter"
    frob = raw_input('Enter frob: ')

Authentication::

    print user

Installation of new client already with token::
